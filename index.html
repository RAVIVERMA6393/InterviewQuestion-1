            Que.2- What are the JavaScript Engines? <br>
            Ans.- A JavaScript engine is a software component that executes JavaScript code. <br>
                  The first JavaScript engines were mere interpreters, but all relevant modern engines use <br>
                  just-in-time compilation for improved performance. JavaScript engines are typically developed <br>
                  by web browser vendors, and every major browser has one. <br>

               1.-V8 from Google is the most used JavaScript engine. <br>
               2.-SpiderMonkey is developed by Mozilla for use in Firefox <br>
               3.-JavaScriptCore is Apple's engine for its Safari browser. <br>
               4.-Chakra is the engine of the Internet Explorer browser

            Que.3- Explain ECMA in JS? <br>
            Ans. ECMAScript is a scripting-language specification that was developed by <br>
                 ECMA International in order to create a standardized JavaScript implementation <br>
                 across all web browsers. It is widely used for client-side scripting in web browsers, <br>
                 and it is also used for server-side scripting with node. js.
        </p>
        <p>
           Que.4-  Why We use JavaScript? <br>
           Ans. JavaScript is a scripting language used to develop web pages. Developed in Netscape, <br>
                JS allows developers to create a dynamic and interactive web page to interact with visitors <br>
                and execute complex actions. It also enables users to load content into a document without reloading the entire page.
        </p>
        <p>
            Que.5- What is JavaScript? And also Explain the histroy of JavaScript? <br>
            Ans. JavaScript is a scripting or programming language that allows you to implement complex features on web pages — every <br>
                 time a web page does more than just sit there and display static information for you to look at — displaying timely content <br>
                 updates, interactive maps, animated 2D/3D graphics, scrolling video jukeboxes, etc. — you can bet that JavaScript is probably <br>
                 involved. It is the third layer of the layer cake of standard web technologies, two of which (HTML and CSS) we have covered in <br>
                 much more detail in other parts of the Learning Area <br>


                 JavaScript is a scripting language that enables you to create dynamically updating content, <br>
                 control multimedia, animate images, and pretty much everything else. <br>

                JavaScript was invented by Brendan Eich in 1995. It was developed for Netscape 2, and became the ECMA-262 standard in 1997. <br>
                After Netscape handed JavaScript over to ECMA, the Mozilla foundation continued to develop JavaScript for the Firefox browser. <br>
                Mozilla's latest version was 1.8. 5.

            Que.6- What is DOM in js? <br>
            Ans. When a web page is loaded, the browser creates a Document Object Model of the page. <br>
                 The HTML DOM model is constructed as a tree of Objects <br>
                 JavaScript can change all the HTML elements in the page <br>
                 JavaScript can change all the CSS styles in the page <br>
                 JavaScript can remove existing HTML elements and attributes <br>
                 JavaScript can add new HTML elements and attributes <br>
                 JavaScript can react to all existing HTML events in the page <br>
                 JavaScript can create new HTML events in the page
